						<p>This fire took place on Forest Valley Drive before the sun rose. <q>I heard something happenin', then I saw some fire and called the emergency services,</q> the neighbor said. The Fire Department arrived soon after and put out the fire with the help of some other local firefighers.</p>
					<h4>September 1 House Fire</h4>
						<p>This fire started around midday at a house on Middle Lake Road. The fire destroyed the house before the Fire Department could even show up. Later, the husband of the household had to go to the hospital because he breathed in too much smoke.</p>
